## THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED
#### the source code for the client is available in the /client folder found [here](/client). 
#### the project was discontinued because: no audience of people to use the service, security concerns for me as well as users as i was hosting it at home on a laptop with ubuntu-server, the fact that I had to use a ngrok tunnel instead of direct IP since my ISP charge a lot of money to make my IP's publicly available, no way to crowdfund money to pay my ISP to make my IP publicly available or buy/rent servers like azure since there is no crowdfunding service available in my country, limited coding knowledge also stops me from making a easily usable service. I only knew python and very little web development (which is why i used a website builder) I made a script in python to upload the file to the servers and then converted that to a .exe (so not compatible with mac or linux unless they had the source code, which had my server's password on it so i couldnt do that) and had to change the ngrok tunnel link each time i had to make changes to the server which meant making another exe and uploading it to /clints/builds, the client app to upload files was a interactive terminal tool which not many people would know how to use.

## UPDATE:
#### I've found that google offers servers for cheap prices (about $0.001/hr which means $1 would get me 40 days.) I've decided to use the cheapest server for handling the website itself and maybe some premium storage (as the server only offers 10GB of storage space) which would have your files directly on the main website (like https://storagerabbit.com/htkantus/somefile.txt) and the rest of the files could be on my own server that runs on ngrok.

#### I'll try my best to get my static IP provided by my ISP public, but from what I can see, you need to pay almost 3x the price for internet to get it.

### Anyways, consider donating. As I said, even a dollar would keep the server running for more than a month. https://paypal.me/HYKANTUS

thanks to the one guy who reads this lol.
