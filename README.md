## THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED
#### the source code for the client is available in the /client folder found [here](/client). 
#### the project was discontinued because: no audience of people to use the service, security concerns for me as well as users as i was hosting it at home on a laptop with ubuntu-server, the fact that I had to use a ngrok tunnel instead of direct IP since my ISP charge a lot of money to make my IP's publicly available, no way to crowdfund money to pay my ISP to make my IP publicly available or buy/rent servers like azure since there is no crowdfunding service available in my country, limited coding knowledge also stops me from making a easily usable service. I only knew python and very little web development (which is why i used a website builder) I made a script in python to upload the file to the servers and then converted that to a .exe (so not compatible with mac or linux unless they had the source code, which had my server's password on it so i couldnt do that) and had to change the ngrok tunnel link each time i had to make changes to the server which meant making another exe and uploading it to /clints/builds, the client app to upload files was a interactive terminal tool which not many people would know how to use.

If you're able to salvage my code somehow then great! email me at *hykantus@gmail.com* or *shadowshlok207@gmail.com* to get in touch with me.

thanks to the one guy who reads this lol.
